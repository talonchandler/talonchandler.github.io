Hi, I'm [Talon](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Hobbit/zEK0ewyRMn4C?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22Just%20at%20that%20moment%20the%20Lord%20of%20the%20Eagles%20swept%20down%20from%20above,%20seized%20him%20in%20his%20talons,%20and%20was%20gone.%22).

I'm an R&D engineer at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in San Francisco.

I received my Ph.D. from the [University][chicago] [of Chicago's][chicago] [Graduate Program in][medphys] [Medical Physics][medphys] in 2020 where I developed spatio-angular microscopes with [Patrick La][patrick] [Rivi&egrave;re][patrick], [Rudolf Oldenbourg][rudolf], and [Hari Shroff](https://www.hhmi.org/scientists/hari-shroff).

I graduated from the [University of British Columbia][ubc] in 2015 with a B.A.Sc. in [Engineering Physics][fizz].

I grew up in a family of apiarists: my parents operate [Scandia Honey](http://scandiahoney.com/) in Southern Alberta, my sister [sells honey](https://chandlerhoney.ca/) in Toronto, and my aunt and uncle operate [Jane's Honey Bees](https://www.janeshoneybees.com) in the Vancouver area.
