Hi, I'm [Talon](https://books.google.com/books?id=pD6arNyKyi8C&pg=PT61&lpg=PT61&dq=%22Just+at+that+moment+the+Lord+of+the+Eagles+swept+down+from+above,+seized+him+in+his+talons,+and+was+gone.%22&source=bl&ots=2kfe5990uE&sig=8_ISf65WbcgOCJikcD5oP2Y2FXk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjO6IfYzvrTAhVLjlQKHXy0CXQQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=%22Just%20at%20that%20moment%20the%20Lord%20of%20the%20Eagles%20swept%20down%20from%20above%2C%20seized%20him%20in%20his%20talons%2C%20and%20was%20gone.%22&f=false).

I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student studying [Medical Physics][medphys] at the [University][chicago] [of Chicago][chicago]. I'm developing polarized light microscopes with [Dr. Patrick La][patrick] [Rivi&egrave;re][patrick] and [Dr. Rudolf Oldenbourg](http://www.mbl.edu/bell/current-faculty/oldenbourg-lab/). 

I graduated from the [University of British Columbia][ubc] in 2015 with a B.A.Sc. in [Engineering Physics][fizz].

I'm interested in physics, [bees](http://scandiahoney.com/), and [ultramarathon running](http://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Talon&lname=Chandler).
