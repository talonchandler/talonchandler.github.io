**I'm Talon Chandler.**

I'll be matriculating at the [University of
Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/) in September 2015 for a PhD in [Medical
Physics](http://medicalphysics.uchicago.edu/).

I graduated from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in
2015 with a BASc in [Engineering Physics](http://www.engphys.ubc.ca/).

I particularly enjoy physics, reading, and ultramarathon running.
